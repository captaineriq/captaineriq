I'm **Ahmad Ariiq Khoironi** — primarily a Java Developer!

My current focus is on designing and managing scalable, maintainable systems, while continuously expanding my knowledge by exploring new technologies.  
I strive to build systems that are simple, scalable, and easy to maintain and upgrade over time. 😄

🔭 Currently working as a Game Developer at **Enchanted Craften** (A Minecraft Bedrock Server).  
⚡ Fun fact: I started programming at the age of 15, trying to build my own Minecraft server!
